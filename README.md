```

## Running

1. Create a new script application at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
    * Click on create an app at the bottom of the page
    * Input a name for your application, for example: <username>-reddsaver
    * Choose "script" as the type of application
    * Set "http://localhost:8080" or any other URL for the redirect url
    * Click on "create app" - you should now see the application has been created
    * Under your application name, you should see a random string - that is your client ID
    * The random string next to the field "secret" is your client secret 
2. Copy the client ID and client secret information returned
3. Create a .env file with the following keys, for example `reddsaver.env`:  
```shell script
CLIENT_ID="<client_id>"
CLIENT_SECRET="<client_secret>"
USERNAME="<username>"
PASSWORD="<password>"
```
_NOTE_: If you have 2FA enabled, please make sure you set `PASSWORD=<password>:<2FA_TOTP_token>` instead

4. Run the app! 
```shell script

# Create a directory to save your images to
mkdir -pv reddsaver/

# Check if you installation is working properly
reddsaver --help

# Check if the right configuration has been picked up
# NOTE: In case the `USERNAME` variable is being overriden by
# your system username, please use 
# On Linux/Mac - unset USERNAME
# On Windows - set USERNAME=
# before running to temporarily remove the system username
# from your environment
reddsaver -e reddsaver.env -d reddsaver --show-config  

# Run the app to download the saved media
reddsaver -e reddsaver.env -d reddsaver

# Also allows you to download upvoted media
reddsaver -e reddsaver.env -d reddsaver --upvoted
```

NOTE: When running the application beyond the first time, if you use the directory as the initial run, the application will skip downloading the images that have already been downloaded.

    -H, --human-readable    Use human readable names for files
    -s, --show-config       Show the current config being used

## Other Information

### Building for Raspberry Pi Zero W

To cross-compile for raspberry pi, this project uses [rust-cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross). Make sure you have docker installed on your development machine.

1. Build the docker image for rust-cross: `docker build -t rust-rpi-zerow:v1-openssl -f Dockerfile.raspberrypizerow .`
2. Make sure that the image name used here matches the image name in your `Cross.toml` configuration
3. Run `cross build --target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi --release` to build the project
4. You can find the compiled binary under `target/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/release/`
